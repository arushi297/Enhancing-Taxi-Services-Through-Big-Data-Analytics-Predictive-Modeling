    **1. Average Fare Per Unit Distance:**
    - Green taxi has the lowest fare per unit distance in most boroughs.
    - Uber and Lyft have a comparative fare per unit distance, being the second lowest overall, except in Bronx and Brooklyn where Yellow taxi has the second 
    lowest fare.

    **2. Average Trip Time Per Unit Distance:**
    - Yellow and Green taxis have considerably higher trip time per unit distance.
    - Uber and Lyft have comparable trip times, which are presumably lower than those of Yellow and Green taxis.""")

    **Insights:**

    1. **Uber Dominance and Regional Variations:** Uber's dominance suggests that it has successfully captured a significant market share in many locations. 
    This could be attributed to factors such as widespread availability, user-friendly app features, and competitive pricing. The presence of yellow taxis in 
    certain zones of Manhattan and Lyft in specific areas of Bronx/Brooklyn indicates that regional preferences and market segmentation exist. Different providers
    may appeal to various demographics or offer specialized services in these specific zones.

    2. **Lyft as the Second Preferred Option:** The fact that Lyft is the second preferred taxi service after Uber highlights its competitiveness in the market. 
    Customers may choose Lyft for reasons such as competitive pricing, perceived service quality, or unique features offered by Lyft that distinguish it from other 
    providers.

    3. **Green Taxi as the Least Preferred:** TThe information about green taxis being the least preferred suggests that customers may have reservations or concerns
    related to this particular service. Possible reasons could include a smaller fleet, limited coverage, or availability compared to Uber and Lyft.
